# Optimal_Pitch_Prediction_Model
This project uses machine learning to predict the optimal pitch type and location to induce a swing and miss or called strike. The model analyzes previous pitch type, previous pitch location, and game state, then outputs recommended pitches based on the probability of a whiff or called strike.
